# Tests

There are two major categories of tests in this solution.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are concerned with testing individual units of code in isolation from the rest of the system.

## Integration Tests

Integration tests are concerned with testing the system components in concert. For this solution, that means driving the system via the API endpoints.
