This folder contains the source code for the sample solution.

## Branching Strategy

The "master" branch has the solution itself, and the stubs for the test assemblies.
The "Mx" branches each demonstrate the different test data generation strategies.

When changes are made to the store solution, they should be made in master and then merged to the other branches so that each strategy branch is running against the same basic solution.
